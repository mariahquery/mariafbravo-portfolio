          Hello, I’m Maria, a passionate designer and developer with over 8
          years experience. I’ve worked for creative agencies, business AI
          companies, and a variety of individual clients.

          <br /><br />

          Whether it's a website, an app, or a complex software system, I bring
          a balanced perspective that integrates the best of both worlds –
          design and development. My goal is to create digital experiences that
          not only look beautiful but also function flawlessly, making every
          interaction enjoyable and memorable.
